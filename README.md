# To-Do List Application

A simple and functional to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to help you learn JavaScript by working on a small, incremental project.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Mark tasks as done by clicking on them.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves tasks using Local Storage, so they stay even after refreshing the page.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Remove all tasks at once.
- **Filter Tasks**: View all, completed, or incomplete tasks (optional improvement).
- **Animations**: Smooth animations for adding, completing, and deleting tasks (optional improvement).
